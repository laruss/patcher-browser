/**
 * The tool contract, transcribed from Claude Code's built-in `AskUserQuestion`
 * so a model that already knows the native tool behaves identically here.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from the native definition, both forced by the fact
 * that Patcher delivers the answer as a tool *result* instead of rewriting the tool
 * call's input the way Claude Code's harness does:
 *
 * 1. The native input schema also carries `answers`, `annotations`, and
 *    `metadata`. Those are not model-authored — Claude Code's harness writes
 *    them back into the recorded call. Advertising them here would be
 *    accepted-but-ignored input that invites a model to invent its own answers,
 *    so they are omitted from the schema and returned in the result instead
 *    (see `ToolResult`, which reproduces their shape exactly).
 * 2. `multiSelect` is advertised as required-with-a-default exactly as Claude
 *    does, but validated leniently (see `toolQuestionSchema`).
 *
 * `questions` — the only branch a model actually authors — is verbatim.

/**
 * Verbatim from Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` tool description, in the form
 * it sends to current models: the main body, the "Reserve this for decisions…"
 * paragraph, and the markdown variant of the Preview block (Claude selects that
 * variant for its own monospace preview box; Patcher renders previews the same way,
 * so the HTML-fragment variant would describe the wrong format).
 *
 * One sentence is adapted rather than copied: Claude's says the UI "switches to
 * a side-by-side layout with a vertical option list on the left and preview on
 * the right". Patcher reveals the preview beneath the selected option instead, and
 * describing a layout the model cannot produce would be a lie in a paragraph
 * whose entire job is telling it what the preview will look like.

export const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Use this tool only when you are blocked on a decision that is genuinely the user's to make: one you cannot resolve from the request, the code, or sensible defaults.

Usage notes:
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide custom text input
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label

Plan mode note: To switch into plan mode, use EnterPlanMode (not this tool). Once in plan mode, use this tool to clarify requirements or choose between approaches BEFORE finalizing your plan. Do NOT use this tool to ask "Is my plan ready?", "Should I proceed?", or otherwise reference "the plan" in questions — the user cannot see the plan until you call ExitPlanMode for approval.

Reserve this for decisions where the user's answer changes what you do next — not for choices with a conventional default or facts you can verify in the codebase yourself. In those cases pick the obvious option, mention it in your response, and proceed.

Preview feature:
Use the optional \`preview\` field on options when presenting concrete artifacts that users need to visually compare:
- ASCII mockups of UI layouts or components
- Code snippets showing different implementations
- Diagram variations
- Configuration examples

Preview content is rendered as markdown in a monospace box. Multi-line text with newlines is supported. The preview is revealed beneath an option once it is selected. Do not use previews for simple preference questions where labels and descriptions suffice. Note: previews are only supported for single-select questions (not multiSelect).

If this call also contained questions with 2 to 4 options (each with distinct labels), you may re-ask those questions alone in a new call.
