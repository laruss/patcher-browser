/**
 * The shared UI kit (@patcher/shared-ui) ships the plugin/no-op flavor of two
 * environment leaves so its component source stays byte-identical across the
 * app, builtin plugins, and the shadcn registry (see packages/shared-ui and
 * packages/plugin-registry). Only the host app has real implementations:
 * `lib/portal-scope` reads the plugin-slot context so host overlays never
 * carry a plugin CSS scope (which would let plugin styles leak onto them),
 * and `hooks/useBrowserDimmingModal` dims the native browser WebContentsView
 * while a modal is open. This plugin redirects shared-ui's own relative
 * imports of those two leaves to the app flavors, so every Dialog the app
 * renders keeps its real behavior; plugin and registry builds resolve the
 * same imports to shared-ui's no-op leaves untouched.
