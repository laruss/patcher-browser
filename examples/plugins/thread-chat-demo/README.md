# patcher-plugin-thread-chat-demo

Demonstrates the SDK's host-owned `ThreadChat` component and the
`messageAction` slot:

- **Nav panel "ThreadChat demo"** — enter any thread id and the panel renders
  that thread's full chat (`<ThreadChat variant="full" layout="contained" />`).
  The "Focus composer" button exercises `focusRequest`.
- **Message action "Open in demo panel"** — appears on every chat message's
  action bar and in the assistant-message text-selection menu. It opens this
  plugin's own thread panel via `context.openPanel({ actionId, params })`,
  passing the anchored message text (or the exact selection) through `params`,
  and renders the current thread compactly with
  `<ThreadChat variant="compact" />`.

## Install

```
patcher plugin install ./examples/plugins/thread-chat-demo
```

## Try it

- Sidebar → "ThreadChat demo": paste a `thr_…` id and chat with the thread
  from the panel. Drafts, queueing, and streaming are the host's real chat
  engine — the plugin only supplied the thread id.
- Open any thread, hover a message, and pick "Open in demo panel" (also
  available when selecting assistant text) to see the message-anchored panel.
