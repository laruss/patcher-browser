# Content script example

This frontend-only enhancement adds a theme-aware focus ring to editable Patcher
surfaces without rendering a React slot. Install it from this directory and
use `patcher plugin dev` to exercise reloads.

The static rule lives in `app.css`, which is Patcher's preferred path for plugin
styles. The script owns only listeners and class names: it observes the
generation `AbortSignal`, returns an idempotent disposer, and removes every
class it installed. Reloading, disabling, removing, or closing the app window
therefore leaves no duplicate listeners or stale DOM state.

Content scripts are trusted same-origin code, not a sandbox. This example only
touches the DOM, but a script has the same access to the app page and
authenticated browser state as ordinary code running in that page.
