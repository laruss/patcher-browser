 * while they work in a column is the one thing it cannot do. That rules out
 * recency: `updatedAt` bumps on every turn, which would shuffle the strip
 * exactly when you are typing in it.
 *
 * So: threads named in `order` come first, in that order, and everything else
 * falls back to `createdAt` ascending. Creation time is immutable, so an
 * un-dragged thread has a fixed slot too, and a new one always appears at the
 * right-hand end rather than jumping to the front. Stale ids in `order` are
 * ignored rather than pruned, so a thread that leaves and returns keeps its
 * slot.
